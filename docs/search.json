The reason for this is that the crew members were responsible for ensuring the safety of the passengers and were therefore less likely to be able to save themselves in the event of an emergency. For passengers, the more luxurious the class, the more likely they were to survive, and the reason for this is that the 1st-class cabins were located closer to the lifeboats, making it easier for 1st-class passengers to reach them in time.\n\n\n\nPhoto taken before the Titanic.

    "text": "As I reflect on the process of creating this website, I realize how transformative it has been to use Generative AI (GenAI) as a tool throughout the journey. When I started building this site, I had a basic vision of what I wanted to showcase—my background, resume, and a bit about my personal life. However, the assistance and capabilities provided by Generative AI have not only made the process faster but have also significantly enhanced the quality and creativity of the content.\n\n\nInitially, my understanding of AI was limited to its ability to perform tasks like generating text or responding to prompts. However, when I began working on this project, I quickly discovered how much GenAI could assist in organizing my thoughts, creating engaging content, and even improving the design structure. From writing descriptions to generating the HTML code for embedding elements like my resume or video, GenAI acted as both a creative collaborator and a technical assistant.\n\n\nOne of the most noticeable ways GenAI helped was in the creation of content. Writing the descriptions for my “About Me” and “Resume” pages was much easier with the help of GenAI, as it provided suggestions, refined my writing, and made the text sound more professional. The tool helped me clarify my thoughts and express them more clearly, which was especially helpful when describing my experiences, skills, and aspirations.\nFor example, when drafting the “Reflection” page, I could use GenAI to draft the initial content and then refine it, adding my personal touch. It was like having an assistant that provided creative prompts but allowed me to mold the ideas into something meaningful and unique.\n\n\n\nOn the technical side, GenAI was incredibly helpful in generating the right code snippets, whether it was for embedding a PDF, creating tables, or adjusting CSS. While I do have some knowledge of web development, the AI allowed me to quickly test different options, troubleshoot errors, and refine my code without having to manually search for solutions.\nUsing GenAI also made the entire process more efficient. Tasks that might have taken me hours, such as formatting tables or figuring out how to embed multimedia, were simplified, allowing me to focus more on the content and less on the technical challenges.\n\n\n\nHowever, as much as Generative AI has been a useful tool, it is important to reflect on the ethical considerations and limitations. For instance, GenAI generates content based on existing knowledge and patterns, which means there is a risk of reinforcing biases or producing content that lacks deep originality. It is crucial to critically evaluate the suggestions and content generated by the AI and ensure that it aligns with my authentic voice and values.\nAnother limitation I encountered was the AI’s occasional lack of understanding of nuanced, highly specific queries. While the AI was effective for general content creation and coding assistance, it struggled when I asked for highly personalized insights or guidance specific to my unique experiences. This reminded me that, while AI can be a powerful tool, human judgment and creativity remain essential to achieving authenticity.\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, using Generative AI for this website has been a deeply enriching experience, but it also reinforced a valuable lesson: the best results come from a blend of human ingenuity and machine assistance. The AI provided the structure and technical framework, but my personal input, creativity, and judgment made the website truly mine.\nAs I move forward with my personal and professional projects, I see AI as an indispensable tool that will continue to support my work. However, I also recognize the importance of balancing its capabilities with my own creativity and critical thinking.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, building this website with the help of Generative AI has been an exciting and thought-provoking experience. The process has not only made me appreciate the capabilities of AI but also deepened my understanding of its potential impact on creativity, efficiency, and problem-solving. As AI technology continues to evolve, I look forward to exploring more ways to integrate it into my work while ensuring that I maintain a strong sense of authenticity and personal expression."

    "text": "Initially, my understanding of AI was limited to its ability to perform tasks like generating text or responding to prompts. However, when I began working on this project, I quickly discovered how much GenAI could assist in organizing my thoughts, creating engaging content, and even improving the design structure. From writing descriptions to generating the HTML code for embedding elements like my resume or video, GenAI acted as both a creative collaborator and a technical assistant.\n\n\nOne of the most noticeable ways GenAI helped was in the creation of content. Writing the descriptions for my “About Me” and “Resume” pages was much easier with the help of GenAI, as it provided suggestions, refined my writing, and made the text sound more professional. The tool helped me clarify my thoughts and express them more clearly, which was especially helpful when describing my experiences, skills, and aspirations.\nFor example, when drafting the “Reflection” page, I could use GenAI to draft the initial content and then refine it, adding my personal touch. It was like having an assistant that provided creative prompts but allowed me to mold the ideas into something meaningful and unique.\n\n\n\nOn the technical side, GenAI was incredibly helpful in generating the right code snippets, whether it was for embedding a PDF, creating tables, or adjusting CSS. While I do have some knowledge of web development, the AI allowed me to quickly test different options, troubleshoot errors, and refine my code without having to manually search for solutions.\nUsing GenAI also made the entire process more efficient. Tasks that might have taken me hours, such as formatting tables or figuring out how to embed multimedia, were simplified, allowing me to focus more on the content and less on the technical challenges.\n\n\n\nHowever, as much as Generative AI has been a useful tool, it is important to reflect on the ethical considerations and limitations. For instance, GenAI generates content based on existing knowledge and patterns, which means there is a risk of reinforcing biases or producing content that lacks deep originality. It is crucial to critically evaluate the suggestions and content generated by the AI and ensure that it aligns with my authentic voice and values.\nAnother limitation I encountered was the AI’s occasional lack of understanding of nuanced, highly specific queries. While the AI was effective for general content creation and coding assistance, it struggled when I asked for highly personalized insights or guidance specific to my unique experiences. This reminded me that, while AI can be a powerful tool, human judgment and creativity remain essential to achieving authenticity."

The AI provided the structure and technical framework, but my personal input, creativity, and judgment made the website truly mine.\nAs I move forward with my personal and professional projects, I see AI as an indispensable tool that will continue to support my work. However, I also recognize the importance of balancing its capabilities with my own creativity and critical thinking."
